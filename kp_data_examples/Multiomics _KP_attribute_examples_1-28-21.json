## Data examples from  Multiomics KP BigGIM SMART APIs, TRAPIv1.0 compliant. Pulled 1-29-21
## Examples to query the KPs provided by the multi-omics provider team Gdoc: https:#docs.google.com/document/d/1tAYiIaS1ueer5ro3wjC-Rvt0aKx2UViF4kvW2hHZQeg/edit
## Below are data examples as they are returned from from the SmartAPI, annotated with  questions. 
## There are also proposed representations of this data using the updated (TRAPIv1.1) Attribute model which allows implementation of SEPIO-based EPC semantics

# KG 1 from BigGIM II: Disease and gene mutation association (TCGA-mut-freq KP). 
# Description: for the current KP, highly frequently mutated genes in different tumor types were extracted from the TCGA datasets. 

# Example 1.1: which genes are associated with GBM? 
# One API result shown below (native Multiomics Structure):

                                      # If the relationship  is  "is gene_has_variant_that_contributes_to_disease", then this frequency data doesn't really qualify the statement, but rather seems like a piece of evidence supporting it.

              "type": "bts:frequency"
            }
          ]
        },

        # MHB: Does the KP want to make the broad assertion that PTEN is mutated in 33% of glioblastomas? Or merely report that in this specific TCGA population, PTEN is mutatd in 33% of glioblastoma cases? If the latter, the association should be qualified by the study population context (as we are doing for clinical associations form ICEES that are similarly based on a single statistical analysis of pateint data)
